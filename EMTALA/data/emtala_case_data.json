The settlement agreement resolves allegations that SMC violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that in May 2024, SMC inappropriately transferred a patient. Specifically, SMC provided a medical screening examination and determined the patient to have a large hematoma along the left carotid artery, with foci of active bleeding, as well as narrowing of the oropharyngeal airway following and endarterectomy performed at another facility (\"Hospital B\") 8 days before coming to SMC's emergency department (ED); the patient was subsequently intubated. The ED physician ordered tests, secured the patient's airway, and consulted telephonically with the on-call vascular surgeon, but that surgeon did not physically come to SMC to evaluate the patient and provide the necessary stabilizing treatment for the patient's emergency medical condition. Instead, the on-call physician requested that the patient be transferred to Hospital B. The benefits of transfer did not outweigh the risks because SMC had the capabilities to provide stabilizing treatment, and the risks included airway loss, respiratory failure, stroke with permanent disability, or death without immediate medical attention.",

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that NCBH violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).  Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that on two occasions in August 2021, NCBH failed to provide adequate medical screening examinations for two patients who presented to NCBH. Specifically in August 2021, a patient presented to NCBH\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) requesting a psychiatric evaluation and a refill of his psychotropic medications. The patient also complained of 8 out of 10 back pain. He was triaged and determined to have abnormal vital signs. Approximately four hours later, the patient was noted in NCHB\u2019s medical records as having left without being seen. The patient returned to NCHB\u2019s ED two days later after jumping off a bridge and being hit by a truck, sustaining injuries from which he died. In August 2021, a patient presented to NCBH\u2019s ED with a chief complaint of psychological issues after being picked up by an ambulance due to a psychiatric disturbance. The patient stated that she thought people were trying to poison her. The patient denied being suicidal or homicidal. While in the ED the patient made bizarre, illogical statements and was experiencing auditory hallucinations. The patient had a known history of schizophrenic effective disorder, bipolar disorder and depression. She was given intravenous fluids and discharged home the following day. There was no detailed psychiatric examination of the patient. At the time of discharge, the patient complained that she could not walk or see, and refused to leave. A doctor talked to her, after which a hospital security guard was called and she was given a bus token and escorted out of the ED. When her mother inquired as to the patient\u2019s whereabouts, the patient was found at a bus stop in a hospital robe. Approximately one week later, the patient was involuntary committed to a psychiatric facility.",

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that BRMC violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).  Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that in July 2021 and May 2021, BRMC failed to provide an adequate medical screening examination for two patients who presented to BRMC. Specifically in July 2021, a patient presented to BRMC\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) complaining of back pain, flank pain, shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient reported that he had recently been treated for an upper respiratory infection and was prescribed medications. While the medications eased the pain initially, the pain had returned and it was now radiating around his lateral chest to his anterior chest. The patient reported that he did work on his truck and then tried to go to work that day and thought working on his truck may have exacerbated his symptoms. At BRMC\u2019s ED, a nurse practitioner (NP) saw the patient and ordered a chest x-ray. The NP read the x-ray and documented \u201cnonspecific changes\u201d as the result. The NP diagnosed the patient with a pulled muscle and prescribed a muscle relaxer and pain medication. BRMC did not take the patient\u2019s temperature. Later that day, a radiologist reviewed the patient\u2019s chest x-ray and noted some acute changes suggesting some opacities with possible pneumonia which was worse on the left side. BRMC did not follow-up with the patient on those x-ray results. When the prescribed medications did not alleviate the patient\u2019s symptoms, he presented to an urgent care center the next day and was referred to another hospital. There he was diagnosed with pneumonia with left lobe collapsed lung (which was not present on the scan the previous day), sepsis and a left pleural effusion. The patient was admitted, treated and discharged five days later. In May 2021, a patient presented to BRMC\u2019s ED complaining of 7 out of 10 chest pain, shortness of breath and numbness in both arms. He reported having chest pain on and off for two weeks. The patient had an extensive cardiac history that included a previous heart attack and two stent placements. Seven minutes after presentment, the patient had an electrocardiogram (EKG), after which an ED physician read it and determined that there were no findings of an acute heart attack and that the patient could wait in the waiting room. The patient was triaged by a nurse, assigned an ESI score of 2 (indicating emergent, needs requiring laboratory or radiological needs) and sent back to the ED waiting room to await bed placement. No further diagnostic testing was ordered and he had not been seen by a physician. Fifty minutes after presentment, an ED physician was assigned to the patient, however, when looking for the patient 100 minutes after presentment, he was listed as \u201coff the floor\u201d. The patient\u2019s wife was reportedly very unhappy that her husband had yet to be seen by a doctor, reported that to the ED desk and told the person at the desk that they were leaving the ED. BRMC\u2019s staff did not discuss leaving against medical advice or what services BRMC was planning to provide the patient. The patient was then discharged in the BRMC\u2019s system. Later that day, the patient was evaluated by a cardiologist. This was pursuant to a previously scheduled appointment. Another EKG was performed which showed sinus rhythm poor R wave progression across the anterior leads. Cardiac catheterization was offered, but the patient wanted to wait and it was scheduled for four days later. The next day, however, the patient presented to another hospital\u2019s ED with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient received another EKG and his troponin I level was 0.16, indicating a potential heart attack. His chest pain was intermittent, but progressively worsened. The patient received a cardiac catheterization that day, which showed his right coronary artery was 99% occluded.",

Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that in May 2021, FH failed to accept the appropriate transfers of two patients when it had specialized capabilities and the capacity to treat the patients.  In the first instance, the patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of a hospital after being assaulted and that hospital determined the patient had an emergency medical condition due to multiple facial fractures from the assault, including fractures to both sides of his lower jaw.  The hospital attempted to transfer the patient to FH because they did not have an oral maxillofacial surgical (OMFS) specialist at their facility.  FH\u2019s transfer call center informed the hospital requesting the transfer that its on-call specialist would not accept the transfer because the OMFS specialist reportedly only treated patients with old trauma fractures rather than new trauma fractures.  In the second instance, the patient presented to the ED of a hospital with complaints of worsening dental pain for the period of a week.  A CT scan performed at that hospital revealed a dental and soft tissue abscess.  The hospital did not have an OMFS specialist to treat the patient\u2019s emergency medical condition and attempted to transfer the patient to FH.  FH\u2019s transfer call center informed the hospital that FH\u2019s on-call OMFS specialist declined the patient transfer because he did not understand why the hospital would be transferring the patient to FH when it was not the closest facility with physicians able to perform stabilizing treatment.  The patient was transferred by ambulance from the hospital to another hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.",

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that FRMC violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).  Based on its investigation and after FRMC self-reported the matter, OIG concluded that in June 2022, FRMC failed to provide an adequate medical screening examination to a patient who presented to FRMC.  OIG alleged that the patient presented to FRMC\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) via ambulance with a complaint of heat exhaustion.  He had been working in a hot factory for seven hours and had a severe frontal headache, nausea, and projectile vomited clear fluids after the ambulance arrived at the factory.  The patient arrived at FRMC\u2019s ED and reported head pain of 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.  He had vomiting or dry heaving, his skin was clammy, and he complained of heat exhaustion.  Diagnostic blood work showed hyponatremia (low blood salt), hypokalemia (low blood potassium), and mild dehydration.  The physician note states he was tachycardiac.  FRMC provided IV fluids for dehydration.  When the ED physician went to speak with the patient, the patient was upset and the physician decided to let him go back to sleep.  One to two hours later, the patient was difficult to arouse, lethargic, and bradycardiac and his respiration rate was slowing.  ED staff tried unsuccessfully to arouse him with ammonia salts.  Believing this could be a drug overdose, the ED physician ordered Narcan, after which the patient became upset and began to walk around the ED.  FRMC contacted the police department to arrest the patient for trespassing.  Meanwhile, the patient sat in an ED hallway chair with arms cross and head down and was unresponsive to ED staff rubbing on his sternum.  The patient was no longer verbal.  Nevertheless, the ED physician cleared the patient for discharge to jail, and police officers carried the patient out of the ED.  FRMC discharged the patient to jail with instructions for adult dehydration and a clinical note of drug overdose.  Less than a day later, the patient was admitted to another hospital and treated for heat exhaustion.",

Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that in April 2023, Resurrection failed to provide an individual who presented to Resurrection\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) complaining of chest pain, nausea, and vomiting, with a timely and appropriate medically screening examination.  Resurrection obtained the patient\u2019s insurance information, but failed to obtain an EKG, perform a pain assessment, and obtain a medical history.  The patient was sent to Resurrection\u2019s waiting area after triage, there he waited an hour, and then, without having received a medical screening examination, he left to seek care at a different hospital where he was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction, an emergency medical condition.",

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that Baptist violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that on three occasions Baptist failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and/or stabilizing treatment. The first patient presented to Baptist\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) in October 2020, via ambulance after being found by law enforcement preparing to jump off a bridge. The patient denied suicidal ideations, stated he had stopped taking his medications and was depressed, and requested to talk to a psychiatrist. An ED physician examined the patient, noting his history of bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, and ordered a psychiatric consultation. ED staff performed a suicide risk assessment, categorized him as \u201chigh risk\u201d and initiated suicide interventions, including 1:1 observation and a bedside attendant. The patient refused to change into blue scrubs and eloped from the ED despite being on 1:1 observation and without having received the ordered psychiatric consultation. ED staff did not witness the patient leave the ED. The second patient presented to Baptist\u2019s ED in May 2021, via ambulance after being found unresponsive in a parking lot. An ED physician diagnosed the patient with acute psychosis and ordered a psychiatric consultation. The patient had a history of bipolar disorder and had not taken his psychiatric medication. The patient was described as uncooperative, angry, having poor eye contact, and a flat effect. Prior to receiving a psychiatric examination, the patient left the ED Against Medical Advice (AMA), stating he no longer wanted to be seen, and refused to sign the required AMA form. ED staff did not inform the patient of the risks and consequences of leaving AMA nor take steps to determine the patient\u2019s mental capacity to decide to leave AMA. That evening, the patient was hit by a car while walking and brought back to Baptist\u2019s ED by ambulance with rib fractures, a collapsed lung, and multiple abrasions and lacerations. The third patient presented to Baptist\u2019s ED in May 2021, with plans to overdose. An ED physician examined the patient and diagnosed her with suicidal ideations and depression. The patient had a history of bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse, and previous suicide attempt. A suicide risk assessment categorized the patient as \u201chigh risk.\u201d ED staff initiated suicide interventions. A urine drug screen returned positive for controlled substances. The on-call  psychiatrist recommended inpatient psychiatric treatment. Approximately 24 hours after presenting, the patient was administered Celexa. Approximately 90 minutes later, she left the ED AMA, prior to receiving stabilizing treatment. ED staff did not take appropriate steps to determine whether the patient had the capacity to decide to leave AMA.",

Freeman informed the patient that the fetus, if born that day, was not viable and that her chances of continuing to carry the fetus to a gestational age for survival were extremely low.\u00a0 In addition, Freeman informed the patient that she was at risk for the following conditions without the appropriate stabilizing treatment of inducing labor: maternal thrombosis (given her history of DVT), infection, sepsis, severe blood loss, hysterotomy, hysterectomy and death. When the patient requested stabilizing treatment for her emergency medical condition, i.e., medical assistance in inducing labor, Freeman offered to hold the patient at the facility for observation in order to monitor the deterioration of the patient\u2019s condition before it would provide the stabilizing treatment she needed.\u00a0 Given the potential risks to her health if stabilizing treatment were delayed, the patient left Freeman to go to another hospital for stabilizing treatment. The patient did not receive stabilizing treatment at the second hospital where she presented. The patient returned to Freeman the next day.  The patient reported continued complications as well as increased cervical dilation.  She stayed at Freeman overnight for observation.  Freeman again offered to continue to monitor her condition to some point of deterioration when it would then provide the stabilizing treatment she needed.  Again, fearful of the risks involved in waiting for her condition to deteriorate before Freeman would provide the needed stabilizing treatment, the patient left Freeman to pursue treatment elsewhere and was discharged home.

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that JHS violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilization treatment to a patient and failed to provide further medical examination and treatment to a second patient. Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that on July 29, 2021, JHS violated the requirements of EMTALA by failing to provide an appropriate medical screening exam and stabilizing treatment to patient C.D. at Jackson South Medical Center (Jackson South). C.D. died in the Jackson South Emergency Department (ED) of complications of novel coronavirus infection after waiting approximately 10 hours without triage or a medical screening examination. OIG also concluded that on October 4, 2021, JHS violated the requirements of EMTALA by failing to provide further medical examination and treatment to patient G.H. who was brought to Jackson Behavioral Health Hospital for psychiatric assessment. The psychiatrist who performed G.H.\u2019s medical screening examination determined that G.H. had an elevated risk of harm to himself and others. The psychiatrist ordered that G.H. be monitored and observed every 15 minutes while in crisis so that a determination could be made regarding admission for stabilization and management, or discharge. The ED staff failed to perform the ordered safety observations and G.H. was found dead in his room approximately 2.5 hours after the last safety check.

Specifically, Holy Cross failed to register M.N. upon arrival to the triage area in the emergency department (ED) accompanied by paramedics and, when M.N. began exhibiting aggressive behaviors, security officers escorted M.N. out of the emergency department and prevented M.N.\u2019s re-entry. Nursing staff spoke to M.N. while M.N. was outside the ED but the ED physician was not alerted of M.N.\u2019s arrival and no assessment of M.N. was performed by ED personnel prior to law enforcement personnel removing M.N. from the premises. M.N. was brought back to the Holy Cross ED approximately five hours later on October 16, 2022, after suffering cardiac arrest at M.N.\u2019s home.

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that LRMC violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to a patient. OIG\u2019s investigation concluded that on September 12, 2021, patient A.R., a 30-year-old male who was physically disabled, bed bound, and ventilator dependent, presented to LRMC\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) via EMS. A.R.\u2019s tracheostomy tube had been dislodged and he had profuse bleeding and continuous airway obstruction. EMS notified the ED about A.R.\u2019s critical condition prior to arrival, including his heart rate of 37 beats per minute and his need for a ventilator. LRMC\u2019s ED did not attempt to divert EMS to another facility after receiving the report of A.R.\u2019s critical condition. After EMS transported A.R. into the ED, they were prohibited from transferring A.R. off their transportation gurney and instructed to take him to a different facility. The ED physician did not enter A.R.\u2019s treatment room and no other qualified medical professional performed a medical screening examination. Additionally, no stabilizing treatment was provided for A.R.\u2019s obstructed airway. LRMC\u2019s failure to screen and to provide any stabilizing treatment caused EMS to leave the ED with A.R. in search of another facility. A.R. went into cardiac arrest just minutes after leaving LRMC\u2019s ED and was pronounced dead upon arrival at a second ED facility. Senior Counsel Julie Redlinger represented OIG.",

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that, based on OIG\u2019s investigation, Lakeside violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an appropriate and timely medical screening examination to a patient. On October 10, 2020, patient N.N., a 37-year-old male, presented to Lakeside\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) by private vehicle at approximately 10:38 am complaining of chest pain and seizure activity. Upon arrival, N.N.\u2019s friend, the driver of the vehicle, parked in the lot across from the ED entrance. After attempting unsuccessfully to assist N.N. out of the vehicle, the friend ran into the ED to request assistance for N.N. The ED registrar instructed the friend to pull around to the ambulance entrance. After returning to the vehicle, the friend managed to assist N.N. out of the vehicle, but struggled to escort N.N. through the parking lot to the ED entrance. Right outside the ED doors, N.N. collapsed, appearing to lose consciousness. Seconds later, a physician assistant walked by N.N. on her way into the ED without acknowledging or offering assistance to N.N., who began seizing and vomiting. At approximately 10:40 a.m., a bystander brought a wheelchair out and assisted the friend in lifting N.N. into a wheelchair. The friend attempted to push the wheelchair into the ED but was unable because N.N.\u2019s legs were caught in the foot pedals. The friend continued to waive his arms toward the ED entrance, seeking medical assistance. At approximately 10:44 a.m., the friend managed to wheel N.N. into the ED. N.N. was immediately brought back to a room to be triaged by ED staff, approximately six minutes after the friend first requested emergency medical assistance. An electrocardiogram revealed that N.N. had suffered a heart attack. At approximately 11:28 a.m., N.N. was taken to the heart catheterization lab for an emergency catheterization and stopped breathing. At 12:27 p.m., N.N. was pronounced dead. Lakeside failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination to N.N., who presented on hospital property suffering from an emergency medical conduction, despite repeated requested for assistance by the friend on behalf of N.N., and despite the fact that N.N. clearly required emergency examination and treatment based on his appearance and behavior.

In two of these incidents, rather than admitting the patient to Tristar Centennial\u2019s onsite psychiatric unit, Parthenon Pavilion, which had the capability and capacity to treat the patient, Tristar Centennial discharged the patient home with an unstable emergency medical condition. For other presentments, rather than admitting the patient to Parthenon Pavilion, Tristar Centennial held the patient inappropriately in its Emergency Department (ED) for over 24 hours before transferring the patient. The decision to transfer the patient, and where to transfer the patient, was made by Tristar Centennial and the Tristar Behavioral Health Transfer Center and was based, in part, on the patient\u2019s insurance status. Tristar Centennial asserts that its decision to transfer the patients was based on a recommendation from a mobile crisis team.

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that, based on OIG's investigation, DeKalb violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), when it failed to provide an adequate screening examination and stabilizing treatment for twenty-one individuals. The following are examples of such incidents. Patient N.R.A., a 25-year-old female, presented to DeKalb's Emergency Department (ED) on January 18, 2015, with complaints of acute gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. The medical records also listed possible pregnancy as her chief complaint. N.R.A. had a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and gastric ulcers. The medical records indicated that N.R.A. was seen by a registered nurse and was triaged using an emergency severity level index at level 4 (indicating a non-urgent patient). The triage nurse recorded N.R.A.'s vital signs and marked \"no\" next to nine questions on a non-patient specific checklist. Within six minutes of the nurse starting the triage process, N.R.A. was discharged from DeKalb's ED. Patient B.B. a 29-year-old male, was brought to DeKalb's ED by an ambulance on February 2, 2015, with complaints of neck pain after suffering from a motor vehicle accident one hour prior to his arrival. B.B. rated his pain at a level 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the worst). The medical records indicate that B.B. was seen by a registered nurse, who triaged him using the emergency severity level index at level 4 (indicating a non-urgent patient). The triage nurse recorded B.B.'s vital signs and marked \"no\" next to nine questions on a non-patient specific checklist. B.B. was then discharged from DeKalb's ED. In each of the incidents described above, DeKalb's ED was capable of providing an appropriate medical screening examination to determine whether the patients had an emergency medical condition and providing stabilizing treatments in the event patients had such conditions, but OIG contends that DeKalb failed to do so. Similar incidents occurred for the following 19 individuals who presented to DeKalb's ED: C.R.B. (1/24/2015); B.N.C. (1/30/2015); D.M.A. (2/2/2015); T.R. (2/3/2015); D.M. (2/6/2015); D.C.W.

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that, based on OIG's investigation, DHA violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an adequate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment for a patient and failed to accept an appropriate transfer of a second patient. The first patient was a 25-year old female who presented to DHA's Emergency Department (ED) complaining of ingestion of an unknown substance and a loss of consciousness. The patient was reportedly tearful and anxious, and complained of a headache, neck pain, face pain, and left shoulder pain. A nurse triaged the patient and gave her an Emergency Severity Index score of three, which was \"urgent\" according to DHA's triage policy. A physician medically screened the patient; however, the screen did not include necessary laboratory tests related to the patient's presenting symptoms. The patient was entered into DHA's medical screening exam process for non-emergent patients and was asked for funds in order to continue evaluation. The patient was unable to pay, so she was discharged. The patient immediately sought treatment at another hospital, where she was treated. The second patient was an 84-year-old female with pneumonia, and severe hypernatremia and hyperglycemia. The patient needed Intensive Care United (ICU) level care and the transferring hospital did not have an ICU. A physician at DHA refused to accept the transfer of the patient, stating that the referring facility could manage the patient. DHA had the capability and the capacity to care for the patient.

A security guard, a hospital employee, put him in a wheelchair and wheeled the patient off hospital property - where he was left on the ground. Approximately four hours later the patient was found cold, with decreased responsiveness. He was transported to another hospital by ambulance. He died two weeks later. The second patient, a 35-year-old male, presented to MIMC's ED accompanied by his girlfriend. The patient complained of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient requested to see a physician and became belligerent when a nurse asked him why. That led to the patient being escorted out of the ED by security. Several minutes later, the patient returned to the ED. This time, the patient's girlfriend drove up to the ambulance bay and reported that the patient had suffered a seizure and was lying in her truck. She was informed by staff that they would not help get the patient out of the truck. In addition, the security guard told her she had to leave.

The settlement resolves allegations that, based on OIG's investigation, SRMC violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening exam, stabilizing treatment, and/or an appropriate transfer for four individuals. Specifically, in the following two instances, SRMC failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and/or stabilizing treatment. The first patient, a 71-year-old male who had been living independently, presented to SRMC's Emergency Department (ED) on January 21, 2016, complaining of leg pain, weakness, inability to walk, and a drastic change in behavior and functioning. His daughter reported that he was occasionally disoriented, but that he had just made a trip to visit her and was in good health. The ED physician ordered labs and IV fluids. After about ten hours, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and weakness. Less than six hours later, the patient returned to the ED with similar symptoms and complaints. This time, another ED physician diagnosed the patient with a traumatic subdural hemorrhage and transferred the patient for brain surgery. At the receiving hospital, the patient remained in critical condition for two weeks with diagnoses of acute respiratory failure, possible stroke, and seizures. The patient passed away the following week. The second patient, a 49-year-old male, presented to SRMC's ED on August 27, 2015, with lethargy and overdose of multiple medications. The patient said he was depressed and expressed suicidal ideations. The ED physician ordered blood and urine tests, an EKG, and a head CT, and noted the patient had a history of depression and chronic back pain. The patient was placed on suicide precaution watch, but no psychiatric evaluation was ordered. The patient was discharged about 4.5 hours later with diagnoses of polypharmacy and asthenia with discharge instructions for near-syncope and weakness. Four days later, the patient died due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. In two additional instances, SRMC failed to meet its EMTALA obligations when it failed to re-evaluate the patient at the time of transfer to determine whether: (1) the benefits to each patient continued to outweigh the risks, (2) the previous arrangements for appropriate personnel and transportation equipment were appropriate given the patient's deterioration, and (3) additional medical treatment was needed to minimize the risks to the individual's health, and in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child. The third patient, a 44-year-old female, presented to SRMC's ED on February 28, 2014 at 3:38 p.m. for evaluation of an altered mental status when she was found unresponsive with an empty bottle of butalbital beside her. A CT scan revealed an extensive acute subarachnoid hemorrhage with possible artery aneurysm bleed. At 9:30 p.m., the ED physician certified that the medical benefits of neurosurgery at a hospital over 122 miles away outweighed the risks of transfer. However, the patient was not transferred until 2:16 a.m. the following day, when her condition had significantly deteriorated. The fourth patient, a 26-year-old who was 28 weeks pregnant, presented to the ED on March 13, 2014 with a complaint of ruptured membranes and lower back discomfort. The ED physician examined the patient at 11:15 a.m. and determined that her unborn child required tertiary services not available at SRMC and certified that the medical benefits of delivery at a hospital over 80 miles away outweighed the risks of transfer. However, the patient was not transferred until 1:00 p.m. Between the time of the ED physician's certification and the patient's transfer, the patient continued to have contractions.

Specifically, the patient, a 17-year-old female, presented to another hospital's Emergency Department (ED), 6 weeks pregnant, complaining of abdominal pain continuing for approximately one week. An ultrasound confirmed the intrauterine fetus with a heartbeat and a left ectopic ruptured mass. The patient needed obstetric care, which was not available at that hospital. Accordingly, the ED contacted the Hospital Corporation of America Transport Center (TC) and requested transfer for a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy. When TC communicated to Peace River's ED that it was trying to facilitate an ED-to-ED transfer, Peace River's representative replied that it did not accept ED-to-ED transfers and hung up. TC called Peace River back and the call was transferred to the ED, where it was reiterated that Peace River did not accept ED-to-ED transfers. The ED employee also mentioned that they had given the transferring hospital the contact information for Peace River's on-call OB/GYN. The transferring hospital called Peace River's on-call OB/GYN who requested all of the patient medical reports be faxed to him before he would consider accepting the patient. During this conversation the doctor learned that the patient was \"out of county\" and he did not accept the transfer. Senior Counsel Sandra Sands represented OIG.",

The patient, a 58-year-old woman, arrived at Piedmont's Emergency Department (ED) by private vehicle, complaining of left-sided pleuritic chest pain and abdominal pain. An ED physician examined the patient and noted that her abdomen was diffusely firm with hypoactive bowel sounds. The patient's blood samples revealed that her lactic acid and bleeding and clotting time were elevated. The patient's chest x-ray showed a large amount of intraperitoneal air under the right diaphragm, which suggested bowel perforation. The ED physician discussed the patient's condition with the on-call surgeon, who recommended that the patient be transferred to the other hospital where she had undergone a dilation and curettage procedure two days earlier. The other hospital agreed to accept the transfer and asked that the patient be air-lifted to its facility. Three hours and forty-seven minutes after her arrival at Piedmont's ED, the patient was transferred to the other hospital in critical condition. Upon arrival at the other hospital, the patient was in septic shock and on the verge of respiratory collapse.

A 13-year-old presented to a hospital Emergency Department (ED) complaining of testicular pain. An ultrasound indicated no evidence of blood flow in the right testicle and a large amount of fluid surrounding the testicle. In order to access the needed specialized services of a urologist, which that hospital did not have, the ED requested that CHS accept the patient for transfer. CHS's on-call urologist, however, refused to accept the transfer of the patient, recommending instead that the patient be transferred to another facility.

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that based on OIG\u2019s investigation, Cambridge violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act when it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination to a patient who presented to Cambridge\u2019s Somerville Hospital campus (Somerville). The patient was experiencing an acute asthma attack, a life-threatening condition needing immediate medical attention. OIG contends that the patient tried unsuccessfully to gain entry to Somerville\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) at its ambulance bay entrance, but the door was locked and unattended. The patient then called 911 and alerted the dispatcher that she was having an asthma attack and could not enter the hospital\u2019s ED. The dispatcher then called the Somerville ED and notified the responding registered nurse (RN) that the patient was experiencing an asthma attack outside the ED doors. Three minutes after this notification, the OIG further contends, the RN opened the ambulance bay door and looked around for the patient but did not let go of the door, search the area outside the entrance, or send another staff member to continue the search. Police and Fire Department emergency responders later found the patient collapsed on a bench adjacent to the Ambulance Bay door in full cardiac arrest with no signs of breathing. The Fire Department emergency responders began life-saving techniques before the patient was brought into the ED. The patient died six days later of hypoxic brain injury. OIG alleged that Cambridge failed to conduct a reasonable search for the patient and therefore failed to provide her with an appropriate medical screening examination after she presented to Cambridge\u2019s Somerville ED.

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that based on OIG\u2019s investigation, DRMC violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act when it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to a patient who presented to DRMC\u2019s Emergency Department (ED). The patient, a 58-year-old woman and resident of a long-term care facility, fell in the shower and was taken to DRMC\u2019s ED for evaluation and treatment. The ED physician initiated a medical screening examination and documented the patient\u2019s symptoms of head pain, altered mental state, and her reported symptom of near fainting. Lab work revealed an abnormal glucose level and abnormal hematocrit results. The ED physician planned to discharge the patient back to the nursing home. Before discharge, it was noticed that the patient\u2019s right arm was swollen compared to when she arrived. Her discharge was cancelled and x-rays were ordered which revealed no evidence of a fracture. Six hours after triage, a nurse reported that the patient required suctioning. Nine hours after triage the patient received a neurological check and the nurse documented that she was not oriented to time, place, person, or situation. The physician then ordered Narcan and a CT scan. Since DRMC\u2019s CT scan could not support the patient\u2019s weight, DRMC\u2019s ED contacted other hospitals to transfer the patient. Approximately 2.5 hours later the patient was admitted to another hospital where she received a CT scan. The CT scan showed a hematoma on her brain as well as Coumadin intoxication. The hospital then ordered an EEG, which showed no brain activity, and the patient died later that day. Senior Counsel Sandra Sands represented OIG.",

Specifically, OIG found seventeen occasions where RMC failed to provide adequate medical screening examinations and improperly transferred or discharged, without providing stabilizing treatment, patients who presented to RMC\u2019s ED with psychiatric emergency medical conditions.

Instead, ROH transferred the patient to another hospital, even though ROH was capable of providing the highest level of care to the patient.

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that LCMC violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment for a 42-year-old female. OIG's investigation revealed the following. The patient arrived at LCMC's emergency department complaining of headaches, right arm pain and diarrhea the previous day. She was seen by a physician's assistant and then asked to wait in the waiting room. While there, she vomited and continued to complain of right arm pain. The physician's assistant concluded that she did not need immediate medical attention and asked the patient to leave the emergency department. When the patient resisted and her family complained, the emergency department personnel called the police to escort her out of the emergency department. After unsuccessful attempts by police and paramedics to get the patient into a car, her family requested the emergency department call an ambulance so she could be taken to another hospital. When the ambulance arrived, the patient was unresponsive and taken to another hospital where she was placed on a ventilator in the Intensive Care Unit and later diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. Under EMTALA, a small hospital can be fined up to $25,000 per violation. Senior Counsel Sandra Sands represented OIG.",

The settlement agreement resolves allegations that SRMH violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to a patient found on SRMH's property. OIG's investigation revealed the following. The patient was seen the previous day in SRMH's emergency department for alcohol withdrawal and neck pain. The physician prescribed a medication for alcohol withdrawal and discharged the patient with instructions for alcohol withdrawal and alcohol abuse. The next morning, the patient was seen by multiple members of the hospital staff, including security, lying on the ground near the perimeter of SRMH's parking lot, possibly in need of medical assistance. Despite being notified several times that the patient may be in need of medical assistance, SRMH failed to respond. Eventually, a staff member who was jogging saw the patient on the ground and called 911. When EMS arrived, the patient had died shortly before EMS's arrival.

Tristar Summit Medical Center in Hermitage, TN is settling allegations by the OIG that it broke the law when it transferred a patient that had come to its emergency department after consuming a bottle of antifreeze without first stabilizing the patient's medical condition. Emergency room personnel, it is alleged, determined the patient should be admitted to an intensive care unit and, despite the availability of a bed in the Tristar Summit ICU, the patient was sent elsewhere because the hospital did not accept the patient's insurance. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) of 1986\u2014often referred to as the patient anti-dumping law\u2014requires a hospital to stabilize a patient's emergency condition within its capabilities prior to transfer, and a hospital may not transfer an unstable patient unless the patient requests transfer or a physician certifies that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks.

EMS contacted emergency room personnel to inform them of the patient's transport but, when the patient arrived at the emergency room, a nurse informed EMS personnel that the medical center could not treat the patient because Trident had a \"no trespass\" order on him.
